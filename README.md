# Password-Generator
- Build from scratch
- Generate two random passwords when the user clicks the button
- Each password should be 15 characters long
- Additional features:
    - Ability to set password length by user instead of set value of 15. For that there should be an input field to enter password length
    - Add "Copy-on-click". When the user clicks any of the two generated passwords, it should be automatically copied to their clipboard.
    - Toggle "symbols" and "numbers" on/off so that the user can chose whether to include them or not in the passwords.
